 Two types of export/import.

 - default export/import

 export default Component;
 import Component from "path";

- named export/import

export const component;
import {component} from "path";


 - A react hook is a just a normal JS function given by react library.
 - A state update will re-render the component.


 - React uses reconciliation algorithm( ReactFiber ) for DOM manipulation. This ReactFiber is introduced in React 16. 
 React creates a virtual DOM( JS object ) which is a representation of a actual DOM tree. when there is a change of state, React compares old virtual DOM with new virtual DOM and updates the real DOM and re-renders the components.

 virtual DOM is not a new concept, it was there from a long time. Its a javascript object representation of real DOM. React made use of this concept and updates DOM efficiently.

 const[ listOfRest, setListOfRest ] = useState(resList);
 useState returns an array. all we are doing in the above line is array destructuring.

 something like below:

 const arr = useState(resList);

 const listOfRest = arr[0];
 const setListOfRest = new updated array list that we are trying to set.

 - React hooks are just normal Javascript functions.
