we can make use of scripts section in package json file to write the commands to start the app and build the app.
"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  },
npm start and npm run start are same
but for build, it should be npm run build. Just npm build will not work.

- JSX is converted to React element by javascript compiler Babel.
- JSX is not HTML, they are different.
- Attributes to JSX will be camel case.  ex: className, tabIndex.

JSX on a single line does not need parenthesis but we can keep it. its needed for multiple lines.

const JSXheading = <h1 className="head"> Namaste React </h1>

const JSXheading = (
  <h1 className="head">
  Namaste React
  </h1> );

  - Prettier formatter is a good VS extension.
  - Bracket pair colorizer is also a nice one.
